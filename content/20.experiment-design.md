## Experiment Design

This section should discuss trade offs and balancing them to design an experiment. 
1. constraints: Each experiment will have different constraints, which may include the number of samples needed for analysis, or desire to quantify a specific subset of proteins within a sample.
2. sample size
3. statistics
4. costs
