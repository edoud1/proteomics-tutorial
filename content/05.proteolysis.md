## Proteolysis {.page_break_before}

1. discussion of protein sequence coverage is determined by the choice of proteolysis
2. why trypsin is the most common choice (charge and length character)
3. theoretical studies of proteolysis and enzyme [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/960902]
4. Challenges associated with alternative enzyme choices (non-specific and semi-specific enzymes)
5. Alternative enzyme choices (one paragraph each?) - LysC
6. GluC
7. AspN
8. Alpha-lytic protease [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m113.034710] and how it enables mapping human SUMO sites [@PMID:29079793].
